Gather Windows
===============

Detaching or attaching a Mac to an external display can sometimes
leave windows placed partially or wholly offscreen. This script can be
used to bring them back to the main desktop (a similar thing can be
done using the "Gather Windows" button of the Displays preference
panel, but this script can be invoked from a keyboard shortcut, if
you need to do this regularly).

Use responsibly.
